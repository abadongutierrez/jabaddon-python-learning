    "# **Build LangGraph Design Patterns: Orchestration & Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimated time needed: **30** minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on lab, you'll master two fundamental agentic design patterns that power modern AI workflows. You'll build a parallel meal planning system that coordinates multiple AI chefs, and an iterative investment advisor that refines recommendations through continuous feedback loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real world impact**: These patterns are used in production systems at leading companies such as Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, IBM, and Google—enabling AI agents to collaborate, self-improve, and tackle complex, multi-step reasoning tasks across domains from research to customer service.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "As AI systems take on more complex problems, a critical challenge arises:  \n",
    "**How can we coordinate multiple agents or components to work collaboratively, intelligently, and adaptively?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **LangGraph** comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangGraph** is a framework for building **stateful, dynamic, and modular AI workflows**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional linear chains, LangGraph enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔄 **Iterative refinement**: Incorporate feedback loops and self-correction logic  \n",
    "- 🧵 **Conditional routing**: Dynamically choose different paths based on intermediate results  \n",
    "- ⚡️ **Parallel execution**: Process independent subtasks concurrently to boost efficiency  \n",
    "- 🧠 **Global state management**: Maintain and evolve shared context across complex workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "With LangGraph, your workflows become more than just pipelines; they become **intelligent systems** capable of reasoning, adapting, and improving over time. This is **ideal** for use cases such as multi-agent collaboration, decision-making, evaluation loops, and planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be loosely following [this](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/#orchestrator-worker) LangGraph tutorial throughout this lab.\n",

    "# Orchestrator-Worker Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The orchestrator-worker pattern is a powerful approach for handling complex, unpredictable tasks by dynamically **breaking them into manageable pieces** and **processing them in parallel**. When you can't predict upfront how many subtasks you'll need or what they'll involve, this pattern shines by intelligently **analyzing** the input, **decomposing** it into structured work units, and **assigning** specialized workers to handle each piece independently. This pattern is widely used in real-world AI workflow systems, including industry solutions such as IBM’s [Watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate?utm_source=skills_network&utm_content=in_lab_content_link&utm_id=Lab-Agentic+Design+Patterns+in+LangGraph-v1_1752612018).\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a busy catering kitchen that takes orders for large events—when a customer orders \"I want a three-course meal, hamburgers for lunch, and pizza for dinner,\" the head chef (orchestrator) analyzes the request and breaks it down into specific dishes, then assigns specialized culinary consultants to create detailed meal plans for each cuisine. Each consultant specializes in a specific cuisine, for example, one expert in Italian cuisine handles the pizza planning, while an American cuisine specialist develops the hamburger menu. The key is that each consultant receives a **clear, structured brief** with dish requirements and dietary considerations, not just \"plan something good.\" In our meal planning system, user requests such as \"feed my family for the week\" could result in anywhere from 3 to 15 different dishes, each requiring a specialist consultant's expertise in their particular cuisine to create comprehensive meal plans.\n",

    "    - `orchestrator`, `chef_worker`, and `synthesizer`\n",
    "4. **Connect the nodes** using:\n",
    "   - `.add_edge(from_node, to_node)` for simple sequential steps\n",

      "\n",
      "📝 Evaluator Feedback:\n",
      "------------------------------\n",
      "This investment strategy is classified as aggressive due to its significant allocation towards high-risk growth assets, such as U.S. growth stocks, emerging market equities, and small-cap stocks, which inherently carry higher volatility and potential for loss. While the strategy aims for a high target return of 15%, it prioritizes capital appreciation over capital preservation, making it suitable for an investor with a high-risk tolerance. The inclusion of fixed income and real assets provides some diversification, but the overall aggressive stance aligns with the investor's goal of achieving financial independence in a relatively short timeframe.\n",
      "\n",
      "📃 Final Investment Plan:\n",
      "------------------------------\n",
      "Given your profile as a 46-year-old high-income earner with a high-risk tolerance and the goal of achieving financial independence by age 60, I will propose a revised investment strategy that targets a 15% return while addressing the evaluator's feedback regarding your previous moderate strategy. This new approach will lean more aggressively towards growth assets, while still ensuring a degree of diversification to manage risk effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Revised Investment Strategy\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. **Asset Allocation Overview**\n",
      "   - **Equities (Growth Focus)**: 70%\n",
      "     - **U.S. Growth Stocks**: 40%\n",
      "       - Focus on sectors like technology, consumer discretionary, and healthcare, emphasizing companies with high growth potential.\n",
      "     - **Emerging Market Equities**: 20%\n",
      "       - Invest in high-growth markets (e.g., Asia, Latin America) to capitalize on economic expansion.\n",
      "     - **Small-Cap Growth Stocks**: 10%\n",
      "       - Target small-cap stocks that have higher potential for growth compared to larger, established firms.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Fixed Income**: 10%\n",
      "     - **Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)**: 5%\n",
      "       - To guard against inflation, ensuring real returns are maintained.\n",
      "     - **High-Yield Corporate Bonds**: 5%\n",
      "       - Focus on bonds with higher returns, accepting some additional risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Real Assets**: 15%\n",
      "     - **Commodities**: 10%\n",
      "       - Invest in a diversified commodities ETF to capture inflationary pressures.\n",
      "     - **Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)**: 5%\n",
      "       - Focus on REITs that provide income and potential for capital appreciation.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Cash and Alternatives**: 5%\n",
      "     - **Cash/Cash Equivalents**: 2.5%\n",
      "       - Maintain liquidity for opportunities and risk management.\n",
      "     - **Alternative Investments (simplified)**: 2.5%\n",
      "       - Instead of hedge funds and private equity, consider a diversified alternative investment ETF. This reduces complexity while still providing exposure to non-correlated assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. **Investment Rationale**\n",
      "- **Equity Focus**: Increasing the allocation to growth equities aligns with your high-risk tolerance and the goal of achieving significant capital appreciation. Emerging markets and small-cap stocks provide exposure to high-growth areas.\n",
      "- **Fixed Income**: The reduced allocation to fixed income reflects a more aggressive stance while still providing some stability through TIPS and high-yield bonds.\n",
      "- **Real Assets**: Emphasizing commodities and REITs allows for inflation protection and diversification into assets that historically perform well in inflationary environments.\n",
      "- **Simplified Alternatives**: By opting for a diversified alternative investment ETF, we maintain exposure to the alternative space without the complexities and risks associated with individual hedge funds or private equity investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. **Portfolio Management**\n",
      "- **Rebalancing**: Conduct regular portfolio reviews (at least quarterly) to rebalance based on performance and changes in market conditions.\n",
      "- **Tactical Adjustments**: Remain responsive to economic signals. For example, if inflation rises unexpectedly, increase exposure to TIPS and commodities. Conversely, if growth accelerates, seek to overweight small-cap and emerging market equities.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "This revised investment strategy leans aggressively into growth areas while still providing some diversification and inflation protection. The focus on equities ensures a higher potential return, aligning with your financial independence goal while addressing previous concerns of moderation. \n",
      "\n",
      "This strategy should position you well for achieving a target return of 15% over the next 14 years, with the adaptability to adjust based on evolving market conditions and personal goals.\n"

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we’ve explored how **LangGraph** empowers you to build dynamic, agentic AI workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout, we learned and applied important concepts such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Orchestrator–Worker Pattern**  \n",
    "   - High-level planning with an orchestrator node  \n",
    "   - Parallel task execution by independent worker nodes  \n",
    "   - Automatic state merging via `Annotated` fields\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reflection Pattern**  \n",
    "   - Iterative generate–evaluate loops inspired by real investor personas  \n",
    "   - Structured feedback using Pydantic output parsers  \n",
    "   - Conditional routing to refine or accept results until they meet targets\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **State Management & Routing**  \n",
    "   - A shared `State` schema carrying context across nodes  \n",
    "   - Flexible fan-out and conditional edges (`Send`, `add_conditional_edges`)  \n",
    "   - Loop control via iteration counters and routing logic\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualization & Testing**  \n",
    "   - Mermaid diagrams for graph structure inspection  \n",
    "   - Manual simulations and pretty-print utilities for debugging and presentation\n",
    "\n",

    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Check out [Watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate?utm_source=skills_network&utm_content=in_lab_content_link&utm_id=Lab-Agentic+Design+Patterns+in+LangGraph-v1_1752612018)**: AI Agents for business to automate and handle simple tasks using orchestration.\n",
    "- **Extend the Patterns**: Try the optimizer (plan–evaluate) pattern or combine reflection with reinforcement learning.\n",
    "- **Domain Adaptation**: Swap out the grocery-list or investment example for customer support, legal drafting, or robotic control.\n",
    "- **Monitoring & Metrics**: Instrument your graph with logging, latency tracking, and success/failure metrics.\n",
    "- **Error Handling & Robustness**: Add retry policies, fallback nodes, and alerting for production readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "By mastering these design patterns—**orchestration**, **evaluation**, **reflection**, and **routing**—you can create truly **agentic systems** that plan, critique, adapt, and improve over time. \n",
